# Programming Assignment #2
A Parser that will recognize and evaluate an arithmetic expression generated by the given context-free grammar G as follows, in which int is a terminal symbol representing integers.
**Instructions and Commands**
1. Utilize these 2 commands in the terminal to update and install flex:
    - 'sudo apt-get update'
    - 'sudo apt-get install flex'
2. If any coding changes were to be done, the command:
    - 'bison -d yacc.y' 
   must be used to save those changes
3. With calc.l, use the command - 
    - 'flex -o calc.l.c lex.l'
    - This will then generate the calc.l.c file.
4. Then use the following commands:
    - 'gcc -o calc calc.l.c yacc.tab.c -lfl -lm'
    - This will compile the code
    and
    - './calc'
    - Which will start the program.
